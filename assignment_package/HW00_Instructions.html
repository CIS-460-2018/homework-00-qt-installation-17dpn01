		<h3>
			1  Goal
		</h3>
		<p>
			In CIS 277, we will be using Qt in nearly all of the homework assignments. In order for you to become familiar with Qt, and to make sure that it runs properly on your computer, you will install Qt Creator and run a simple test program that we supply you.
		</p>
		<h3>
			2  Requirements
		</h3>
		<h4>
			2.1  Install Qt Creator
		</h4>
		<p>
			Go to the <a href = "http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/">Qt web site</a> and download one of the installers for Qt, though we recommend the online installer. During the installation process, just make sure that you install Qt 5.4, which is the version we'll be requiring for this course and is the version that is installed in the Moore 100 labs.
			<br/>
			<br/>
			If you will not be using your laptop for this course, you may use the computers in Moore 100 A, B, or C since they all have Qt 5.4 installed on them.
		</p>
		<h4>
			2.2  Test your installation
		</h4>
		<p>
			Open the Qt project included in this homework assignment package in Qt Creator. The .pro file in the Qt_GL_Test folder is the one you should open. Once you've opened the project file, you should configure it to use Qt 5.4.0. Run the program by pressing the button with the green arrow in the lower-left portion of the UI. When run, the program should produce the following image:
			<br/>
			<img src = "expected_results.jpg"/>
		</p>
		<h3>
			3  Submission
		</h3>
		<p>
			We do not require you to submit anything for this homework assignment. As long as the program produces the image above, you should be good to go for future assignments.
